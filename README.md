# ZK DEX

A zero-knowledge proof based decentralized exchange implementation leveraging Sparse Merkle Trees for privacy-preserving balance verification. This project combines Solidity smart contracts with TypeScript utilities to enable confidential trading while maintaining transparency and verifiability through cryptographic proofs.

The system utilizes Poseidon hashing and ZK-Kit's Sparse Merkle Tree implementation to create a secure and efficient balance sheet management system that protects user privacy without sacrificing the integrity of the exchange operations.
